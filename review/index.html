    <h2>Gameplay and Mechanics</h2>

    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>
      Silksong builds upon the mechanics of Hollow Knight, Introducing new
      abilities and combat styles in the forms of crests and tools.
      <br />
      The game also brings back a variety of existing mechanics, such as the
      ability to dash, wall jump, and double jump.
      <br />
      At its core, Silksong has the same gameplay loop as Hollow Knight, which
      is to explore a dangerous world, and defeat challenging bosses while
      uncovering the story of the game.

      <strong>Official Description:</strong>
      <em>
        An optimistic pilgrim on a spiritual journey. Sherma’s path may often
        cross with Hornet’s own, but his lack of combat and acrobatic prowess
        can land him in desperate need of aid.
      </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Sherma is a friendly NPC who the player meets early in the game. He is a
      pilgrim who is on a journey to reach the top of the game world. He
      seemingly has no function other than to act cute and bond with the player.
      <br />
      In the previous game, a similar character called Myla was killed during
      the game's events, leading most players to dread the same fate for Sherma.
