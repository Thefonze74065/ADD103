    <h2>Clothing</h2>
    <p>
      During Holi, people wear white clothing that can be easily stained with
      colors. Typically, most people wear white kurtas made of cotton, which are
      comfortable and breathable for the outdoor festivities. However, some
      people may choose to wear different clothing, such as a Lohri Dress for a
      more ethnic look. Tie dye shirts have also gained popularity, for those
      who want to show off color without getting covered in powder.
    </p>
    <h2>Activities</h2>

      Holi is celebrated over a wide area with various activities, so the exact
      customs may vary. However, some common traditions include: Throwing
      colored powders and water at eachother. Singing, dancing, and sharing
      festive foods and sweets.
