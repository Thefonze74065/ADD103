		<h1>3D Printers</h1>
		<p>
			3D printers are machines that create objects layer by layer from digital
			designs. Instead of cutting or shaping material, they build things from
			the ground up, often using plastics, resins, or even metals.
		</p>
		<h2>Types of 3D Printers</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling):</b> The most common type, using
				melted plastic filament.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>SLA (Stereolithography):</b> Uses liquid resin cured with UV light
				for detailed prints.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>SLS (Selective Laser Sintering):</b> Fuses powdered material with a
				laser, often used for durable prototypes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What Can You Make?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Prototypes:</b> Test product designs quickly and affordably.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Custom Parts:</b> Replace broken pieces or create unique fittings.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Models & Art:</b> From miniatures to sculptures, creativity has no
				limits.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Why Use It?</h2>
		<p>
			3D printing is perfect for rapid prototyping, customization, and
			small-scale production without expensive tooling.
