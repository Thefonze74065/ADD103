    <h1>About Alin Gupta</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Alin - a student at
      <a href="https://mchenry.edu/">McHenry County College</a>, And I'm taking
      this course inorder to learn more about HTML, css frameworks, and HTML
      best practices. <br />
      I've managed to cobble together a few websites in the past, but I usually
      run into issues that education in the subject should help me avoid.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>3d printing (or using any other cool machine to make stuff)</h3>

        <p>
          I've been 3d printing for over a decade now, and I love it's
          versatility. <br />
          I design niche, useful items that solve problems in my daily life,
          which allows me to save money. <br />
          I use both FDM and resin printers, depending on the use case. <br />
          I also use other machines, like laser cutters, CNC mills, lathes, and
          a metal vaccuum cast system.

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <img src="images/food-6465556_1280.jpg" alt="A 3d printer (Modified Voron V0)" height="400"></img>
        <p>
          I like good food and trying new recipes. <br />
          I've been cooking from a young age and attended culinary classes in
          the past, so I can take a decent shot at making whatever dish i want
          to try.<br />
          I even looked into pursuing it as a career, but decided I would not be
          able to work the extended hours.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I have been programming as a hobby since I was a child. <br />
          While I never learned more advanced topics, I gained enough skill to
          finish various hobby projects. <br />
          From smart home automation to game development, programming has served
          as a useful tool for me to create whatever I want.

    <h2>Cats</h2>

    <h3>My cats</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Chai</li>
      <li>Zelda</li>
      <li>Pixel</li>
      <li>Ritz</li>
      <li>Miso</li>
      <li>Gatsby</li>
      <li>Bailey</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Foster Kittens</h3>
    <p>
      I also have been fostering kittens for just under two years. I just
      dropped off the latest batch to the shelter for adoption, a set of 7.
      <br />
      Fostering needs a lot of work and time, but it's very rewarding, and I
      love playing them and watching them grow up. <br />
      However, I'll be taking a break from fostering for a while in order to
      focus on my classes.
