					<h2>Tools and Experience</h2>
					<p>
						I have experience with a variety of maker tools. 3d printers, laser
						cutters, and cnc machines to name a few. I have experience
						assembling and troubleshooting 3d printers, and have built a few
						from kits. I have used laser cutters to make a variety of projects,
						from simple keychains to mechanical assemblies. I have used CNC
						machines to machine aluminum to make pins, and I have a basic vacuum
						casting setup in my garage.

					<h2>Metal Casting</h2>
					<p>
						I have a small metal casting setup in my garage, and I have casted
						aluminum, zinc, brass, and some basic alloys. The crown jewel of the
						setup is a vacuum casting machine, which I can use to cast intricate
						designs with high detail.
