            I've been cooking since I was very young, and have attended a
            variety of junior culinary classes in Paris, London, and the US. My
            most notable experience was attending Le Petit Cordon Bleu in Paris,
            where I learned the fundamentals of French cuisine.

            Indian cuisine is known for spices. I grew up eating it, and I love
            the variety of flavors possible within the cuisine. My favorite
            Indian dishes would have to be Pakora ki Kahdi, or Chicken Korma.

          <p>
            French cooking taught me the importance of technique and subtlety of
            flavor. My fundamentals are rooted in this cuisine, from sauces to
            what I know of baking. My favorite dish to make is French Onion
            Soup, which can be prepared in a variety of ways depending on the
            level of work I'm willing to put in.

          <p>
            I enjoy making food reminiscent of American Diners from the 1980s.
            From Burgers and fries to Salsbury Steak and Steak Diane, I love the
            strong flavors - Though I usually cut down on the portion size.
